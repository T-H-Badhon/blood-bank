        <p>
            A blood bank is a facility that collects, tests, processes, and stores blood and its components for later use in medical treatments. The primary purpose of a blood bank is to ensure a safe and adequate supply of blood for transfusions and other medical procedures that require blood products.

                In the context of blood donation, the duties or responsibilities of a blood recipient are not directly assigned by the blood donor. However, as a blood recipient, there are certain general expectations and responsibilities that can be considered.It's worth noting that these responsibilities are generally considered ethical or voluntary in nature. The primary focus for a blood recipient is on their own health and well-being, following medical guidance, and expressing gratitude for the life-saving gift of donated blood.
